### What I learned

I've revisited this project because I'd like to have a refresher on how to write OOP in JavaScript.

### Continued development

I'm planning to do the final considerations that Jonas have point out from his course. Those considerations feels like a hard challenge but I like to come out of my comfort zone specially when it comes to challenges and see how far I can go.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank Mr. Jonas Schmedtmann for teaching me the core fundamentals of JavaScript. I've learnt a lot from his course not only how to write a code in JavaScript but also how to write an effective program for both users and developers.
